Performance Testing
===================

Introduction
------------

.. todo::

	Write guide on this.

These functions provide performance testing support, allowing for the quick
comparison of models, experiment design heuristics and quality parameters.
QInfer's performance testing functionality can be quickly applied without
writing lots of boilerplate code every time. For instance::

	>>> import qinfer
	>>> n_particles = int(1e5)
	>>> perf = qinfer.perf_test(
	...     qinfer.SimplePrecessionModel(), n_particles,
	...     qinfer.UniformDistribution([0, 1]), 200,
	...     qinfer.ExpSparseHeuristic
	... )

Performance Results Structure
-----------------------------

Perfromance results, as collected by :func:`perf_test`, are returned as
a `record array`_ with several fields, each describing a different
metric collected by QInfer about the performance. For a single performance
trial, the shape of this array is ``(n_exp, )``, such that ``perf[idx_exp]``
returns metrics describing the performance immediately following collecting
the datum ``idx_exp``.

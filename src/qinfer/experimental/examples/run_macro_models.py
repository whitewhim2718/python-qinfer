## MACROPY ACTIVATION ########################################################

# The following line is needed to activate all MacroPy features. Nothing will
# work without this import. It's basically magic.
from __future__ import absolute_import
import macropy.activate

# We can export code as macros are applied, such that we don't need to depend
# on MacroPy to ship models made using these macros.
#
# This may generate errors if you cannot write to folders where macros are
# invoked; in particular, this will be the case if you have installed MacroPy
# to a site-packages directory.
# Until we find a good way to enable exporting in a robust manner, this will
# be commented out.
import macropy.core.exporters
#macropy.exporter = macropy.core.exporters.SaveExporter("exported")

# Finally, we can now import the module containing the macro-defined models.
# Since MacroPy has been activated, it will intercept this import using
# the New Import Hooks feature (PEP 302) and transform the module before
# executing it. The exporter will then save a copy of the transformed
# module.
import qinfer.experimental.examples.macro_models as mm

# We now can run the main() function defined there.
mm.main()

"""
This module exposes macros; this is not an intrinsic part of the Python
language, but can be added using import hooks. This is done by the `MacroPy`_
library.

Please note that this module is, by virtue of being an unapologetic hack,
buggy as... well, use your imagination.

    makes a new QInfer model based on interpreting
    ``likelihood_expr`` as the probability of a
    "0" outcome in a two-outcome model.

    Any variables of named mp_* in likelihood_expr are
    interpreted as named model parameters, and will be
    appropriately vectorized. Any variables named as
    ep_* are taken to be experimental parameters, and
    will be used to construct expparams_dtype.

    Example::

        @modelclass({'t': float}, [mp_w1 > 0, mp_w2 > 0])
        class MacroMadeModel():
            '''
            This will be turned into a model with two
            model parameters, w1 and w2, and with one
            expeirmental parameter, t.

            Valid models must have w1 > 0 and w2 > 0.
            '''
            dw = mp_w1 - mp_w2
            # Note that there is no return statement
            # here; the last line is returned implicitly.

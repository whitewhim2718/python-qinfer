class DirectViewParallelizedModel(DerivedModel):
    r"""
    Given an instance of a `Model`, parallelizes execution of that model's
    likelihood by breaking the ``modelparams`` array into segments and
    executing a segment on each member of a :ref:`~IPython.parallel.DirectView`.
    
    This :ref:`Model` assumes that it has ownership over the DirectView, such
    that no other processes will send tasks during the lifetime of the Model.
    
    TODO: describe parameters.

    :param bool purge_client: If ``True``, then this model will purge results
        and metadata from the IPython client whenever the model cache is cleared.
        This is useful for solving memory leaks caused by very large numbers of
        calls to ``likelihood``. By default, this is disabled, since enabling
        this option can cause data loss if the client is being sent other tasks
        during the operation of this model.

    ## SETUP AND TEARDOWN ##
    # We want every test method to be setup first by seeding NumPy's random
    # number generator with a predictable seed (namely: zero). This way,
    # all of our tests are *deterministic*, and once first checked, will
    # not deviate from that behavior unless there is a change to the underlying
    # functionality.
    #
    # We do this by using the fact that nosetests and unittest both call
    # the method named "setUp" (note the capitalization!) before each
    # test method.
    
    def setUp(self):
        # TODO: move this into a base class for deteministic unit tests!
